Ever wanted to know how these cute looking screenshot are taken?

![](/img/carbon-screenshot.png)

My answer is [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh).

Carbon is an online solution to create screenshot of code, with customizable theme, background color and support a lot of language syntax.
The website allows export in png, svg, or can create a link to the screenshot.

Happy hacking!
