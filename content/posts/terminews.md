I recently got used to view informations using RSS. It allows me to ignore ads, distractions and to focus on the on the essential: having all the informations that I want in the same place. And it save a really consequent amount of time.

Furthermore, I love the terminal, I like to use it excessively and I prefer It over GUI applications. That's good because I've found a wonderful CLI application to read RSS: terminews.

Terminews is a Go written application that allows to save multiple RSS flux to allow reading directly from the terminal. The video below show how it works:
