We can all agree that itâ€™s been a quite... **awkward** year to say the least.

We went through massive fires around the globe, almost reaching WWIII, a pandemic that forced whole countries to go under a lockdown, etcâ€¦ 
Each event being more tragic than the others, and no one could believe what we were living.

And yet, weâ€™ve made it through this hell of a year, *weâ€™ve survived 2020!*

# A bit of positivity

I think itâ€™s our responsibility to focus on the best of every situation, if you think about it,
I'm pretty sure 2020 has seen some of the best memories you ever had.

For me, 2020 has seen a lot of good times: 

- the COVID-19 pandemic has enabled remote working, and allowed me to work
from home for almost a year now, which has made my life so much better: better sleep quality, more time (+4hrs) for
my family, and I have never been so happy.
- I changed job, now working in online brand protection, and the work is so interesting, there's a lot
of things to learn, to experiment and to create.
- It's been another year with my girlfriend, and the lockdown has given us a lot of spare time together.

So, what was your favorite time this year? 

# Resolutions

For those who remember I'm always trying to set some goals for the year. I've written a [blog post](https://blog.creekorful.org/2020/01/taking-new-year-resolutions-seriously/) last year
about this.

Out of the 4 big resolutions I have undertaken, **3** of them has been accomplished, so I'm pretty happy about it!

And you, have you accomplished one of your goal this year?

# Conclusion

I'll conclude this short blog post with a quote from Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:

> Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.

Happy 2021 folks ğŸ’™
