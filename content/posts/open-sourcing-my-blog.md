I have received a lot of positives feedback for my blog lately,
and I do really appreciate it and try to integrate the suggestions 
to update my posts and make things better.

With the aim of continous improvement of this blog, I have decided (a bit late?) to open source it.
The source code is now available on [Github](https://github.com/creekorful/blog)!

Feel free to open a PR if you want to fix a typo or if you see a mistake in one examples
while reading an article.

Don't hesitate, every little improvements matter. :D

Happy hacking!
